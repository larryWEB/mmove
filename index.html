    <h1>How we Work</h1>
    <p>As a digital solution company, we work closely with our clients to understand 
        their unique business needs and goals. Here is a brief overview of how we work:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="work-details">
<h3>01.</h3>
<h4>Discovery</h4>
<p>We start by understanding our client's business needs and objectives. This includes researching the target audience,
     identifying business goals, and determining the key features and functionalities of the website.</p>
     <div class="work-img">

        <div class="work-details">
<h3>02.</h3>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p> Based on the information gathered during the discovery phase, 
    we create a detailed plan that outlines the project's scope, timeline, 
    and budget. We work closely with our clients to ensure that their expectations
     are met and that the project stays on track.

<h3>03.</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>Once the planning stage is complete, we move on to the design phase. Our designers create a visual concept for the website,
     which includes the layout, color scheme, typography, and imagery.
</p>

        <div class="work-details">
<h3>05.</h3>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p> Before the website goes live, we perform thorough testing to ensure that it functions correctly and that there are no issues or bugs. This includes testing the website's performance, security,
